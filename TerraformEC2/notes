##security_groups refers to ec2-classic that runs on flat network and probably get reinitiated on each creation, vpc_security_group_ids is the modern and standard way for associate ##firewall rules to your ec2 in a vpc netwrok - therefore it's persisted and you should pick this one, It won't initiate and recreate itself on each terraform apply.
